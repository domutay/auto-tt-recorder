# A GUIDE ON AUDIO BALANCING #
##############################

# Step 1:
# Run the script with the following settings
chadsoft-read-cache: false
chadsoft-write-cache: true
encode-only: false
input-display-dont-create: false
dolphin-resolution: 480p
h26x-preset: ultrafast
game-volume: 0.6
music-volume: 1.0
output-width: null

# Step 2:
# View the output video. If you are content with the audio balancing, proceed to Step 3.
# Otherwise, do the following:
# - Change the value of chadsoft-read-cache to true
# - Change the value of encode-only to true
# - Change the value of input-display-dont-create to true
# - Adjust the values of game-volume and music-volume
#   - These values are just multipliers, e.g. 0.5 makes the volume half as loud.
# Then, run the script again, and repeat the above steps until you are content with the audio balancing.

# Step 3:
# Change the following settings:
# - encode-only to false
# - dolphin-resolution to your desired resolution
#   - Valid values are: 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 2160p
# - h26x-preset to slow
# - output-width to the width of the output video:
#   - For 2160p, set this to 3840
#   - For 1440p, set this to 2560
#   - For 1080p, set this to 1920
#   - For 720p, set this to 1280
#   - For 480p, set this to 854
# Then, run the script again.

# Step 4:
# Change the settings back to the default values (for next time)
# The default values are repeated below

# chadsoft-read-cache: false
# chadsoft-write-cache: true
# encode-only: false
# input-display-dont-create: false
# dolphin-resolution: 480p
# h26x-preset: ultrafast
# game-volume: 0.6
# music-volume: 1.0
# output-width: null
